## How to Fork a GitHub Repository

Forking a repository on GitHub allows you to create a copy of a repository under your own account. This is useful for contributing to open-source projects or modifying a project without affecting the original repository. Follow these steps to fork a repository:

## Step 1: Sign in to GitHub
1. Open a web browser and navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Sign in to your GitHub account. If you don't have an account, create one.

## Step 2: Find the Repository to Fork
1. Use the GitHub search bar to find the repository you want to fork.
2. Click on the repository name to open it.

## Step 3: Fork the Repository
1. In the top-right corner of the repository page, click the **Fork** button.
2. GitHub will create a copy of the repository in your own account.

## Step 4: Clone the Forked Repository Using VS Code (Optional)
To work on the repository locally, clone it to your computer using Visual Studio Code:

1. Open **Visual Studio Code**.
2. Click on **Source Control** (or press `Ctrl + Shift + G` / `Cmd + Shift + G` on Mac).
3. Click on **Clone Repository**.

5. Select a local folder to store the repository when prompted.
6. Once the cloning process is complete, open the repository in VS Code.

## Step 5: Configure the Upstream Repository (Optional)
If you want to contribute to the original repository, you should set up an upstream remote in GitHub:

1. Open your forked repository on GitHub.
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Under **GitHub Remotes**, add the original repository as an upstream remote.
4. Verify that your fork is correctly linked to the upstream repository.

## Step 6: Sync Your Fork with the Original Repository (Optional)
To keep your fork updated with the latest changes from the original repository using VS Code:

1. Open VS Code and navigate to your forked repository.
2. Click on **Source Control**.
3. Click on **Fetch from all remotes** to check for updates.
4. If updates are available, click **Pull** to merge changes into your local copy.

## Step 7: Make Changes and Submit a Pull Request
